JobDigitalThread_IoT_Push: the experiment with the push-only synchronization method, no pull and local simulation, with data directly from IIoT devices.

JobDigitalThread_DT_Push: the experiment with the push-only synchronization method, no pull and local simulation, with data from eDT updates.

JobDigitalThread_DT_Simulate: the experiment with the push-only synchronization method, no push and/or pull from remote site.

JobDigitalThread_FullyEvolution: the experiment with the push-sim-pull synchronization method, with all DTs evolvable, i.e., all supporting local simulation.

JobDigitalThread: the experiment with the push-sim-pull synchronization method, with half DTs evolvable, i.e., half of them supporting push-pull (i.e., context DTs) and the other supporting simulate-pull (i.e., system DTs).
